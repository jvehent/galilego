Galilego - a HTTP/2 web gallery written in Go
=============================================

Retrieve it via `go get github.com/jvehent/galilego`, the resulting `galilego`
binary will be placed under $GOPATH/bin/galilego. Set your configuration file
and run the galery with `$GOPATH/bin/galilego -c config.yaml`.

This is a proof of concept, not meant to be polished or production-ready.

Example configuration can be found in config.yaml.
