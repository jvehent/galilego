Galilego - a HTTP/2 web gallery written in Go
=============================================

Put your photos in the `gallery` folder and run the gallery with `go run main.go`.

You can also build a binary with `go build -o galilego main.go`. Make sure to
retrieve all the go deps beforehand. Yeah, a makefile would be nice, wouldn't it?

This is a proof of concept, not meant to be polished or production-ready.
